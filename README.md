Assignment Name: Codeforces Problem 4A: Watermelon

Description:

Watermelon Problem (Codeforces 4A)

Problem Statement
Pete and Billy bought a watermelon. They want to divide it fairly so that each person gets an even-weight piece (no odd weights allowed). Your task is to determine if it's possible to divide the watermelon into two parts, where each part has an even weight.

Input
- A single integer `w` (1 ≤ w ≤ 100) representing the weight of the watermelon in kilograms

Output
- Print "YES" if it's possible to divide the watermelon into two even-weight parts
- Print "NO" if it's not possible

Examples

Example 1:
- Input: `8`
- Output: `YES`
- Explanation: You can divide 8 into 2+6 or 4+4

Example 2:
- Input: `3`
- Output: `NO`
- Explanation: Cannot divide 3 into two even numbers

Example 3:
- Input: `2`
- Output: `NO`
- Explanation: Cannot divide 2 into two positive even numbers (1+1 doesn't work)

Requirements
- Write your solution in Python
- Your program should read input from standard input (use `input()`)
- Print the result to standard output

Submission Instructions
1. Submit your Github repo Python (.py) file
2. Test your code with all three examples above
3. Optional: Test your solution on Codeforces (https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A)
Links to an external site.
4. Write a reflection on your approach to the solution.  
5. Include a disclosure and copy of prompt if GenAI utilized.

* Note: To be able to submit your solution on Codeforces you will need to create an account, 
  confirm your email address and login.

Grading Criteria
- Correct output for all test cases
- Code quality and readability
